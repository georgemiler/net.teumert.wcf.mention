@Mentions & #Hashtags for WCF
=============================

This package provides @User mention and #Hashtag auto-linking for WoltLab Community Frameworkâ„¢ (WCF) 2.0.

It uses the power of Twitter, since it is built on top of the incredible twitter-text-php library, a PHP port of twitters text libraries for java and other languages.


Features:
---------

* Auto-linking of @User mentions
* #Hashtag auto-linking to search form
* [Optional] Notification of mentioned user via notification system
* [Optional] Tracking of mentions - Every user gets a profile page with all posts in which he has been mentioned. Can be made private (hidden from others).


Thanks & Contributions:
-----------------------

I want to thank the following persons for their efforts on the twitter-text-php library (<https://github.com/ngnpope/twitter-text-php>), which is used by this plugin.

* Matt Sanford (<https://github.com/mzsanford>) for the orignal Ruby and Java implementions.
* Mike Cochrane (<https://github.com/mikenz>) for the initial PHP code.
* Nick Pope (<https://github.com/ngnpope>) For the bulk of the maintenance work to date.
